 fbavariad.1.t: "A Date with Stalin" #NT!
 fbavariad.1.d: "It was a sunny day when you and Joseph Stalin first met. It was beautiful. Munich was beautiful. And Stalin was beautiful. He talked for hours about the glorious communist manifesto. The great work of Lenin. The treachery of Trotsky. When the purges got brought up he claimed he only did them for you. So that the two of you could live in a safe world.\n\nYou held hands as the sun set and the sky was filled with red." #NT!

 fbavariad.2.t: "Back with Stalin" #NT!
 fbavariad.2.d: "You and Stalin both met at a cafe for your second date. Stalin talked a lot about random political stuff, stupid opposition figures, and how silly some of there citizens could be. You sat and laughed, uninterested in what they were saying, but happy to be someone to talk to. " #NT!

 fbavariad.4.d: "Wow. It was already your third date with the man himself. You put on your prettiest dress and Stalin put on his very formal white military uniform. He laughed as you teased him about how terrible the infrastructure situation in Russia was. He assured you his countless supply of manpower would surely make up for any lack of industrial development.\n\nAs the sun set, you shared a milkshake and talked about the Russian civil war. His words seemed to become mute and fade to dust as you were mesmerized by the conviction in his voice. Every syllable, pronounced perfectly in a language you didn’t really understand that well. It was something you would never forget. So fluid. So tender.\n\nThen suddenly, a man burst into the room. This man was no ordinary man. This man was LEON TROTSKY. \"Impossible!\" Stalin shouted. Trotsky then pulled out a gun and pointed it at your lover." #NT!

 fbavariad.5.t: "The End" #NT!
 fbavariad.5.d: "You ran out of the way, but before you could react Leon Trotsky was already on the ground. Stabbed in the back by an icepick, he said some mean bad guy words before biting the dust. For a second you and Stalin stood there. Looking at each other. He then slowly brushed the dust off his uniform and stood up. He walked over and shook hands with the bloodied NKVD agent and then turned to you. He couldn’t stop apologizing for how things went. He was genuinely sad. You could even notice a tear streaming down his face. Even after being seconds away from a brutal end, he could only think about you. \"Weally, Stalin-chan, don’t worry,\" you said as you pulled him in for a kiss." #NT!

 fbavariad.7.t: "A Date with Frank" #NT!
 fbavariad.7.d: "The US was kind of cool, and Frank was really cool. He taught you all sorts of things. He taught you all sorts of things. He taught you how to make a hamburger. He taught you how to win an election. He also taught you how to fish. At first you thought it was kind of lame, but he insisted that your first date be a fishing trip. You wheeled him out to this very pretty pond and the two of you talked about politics. As you talked Frank was catching like a million fish and you become super jealous. You asked one of the FBI agents if you were doing it right but he only responded with a deathly stare. By the end of the date Frank had caught over a gazillion fish and you had nothing." #NT!

 fbavariad.10.d: "For your third date you met in the great oval office. It was very nice and professional. And for the first time, you were somewhere where none of the silly FBI agents would be listening. You sat on the table and the two of you talked for hours about the nuclear bomb. You thought it was really cool, but he kept insisting that it was a terrible weapon. “Hey, I just hope yuwu never use it, but explosions are still cool!\" You tried to explain to him how much you loved sparkles and fireworks, but he didn’t seem to understand. After 5 minutes of awkwardness, he finally opened up. He was jealous. He thought you loved the nukes more than him. Simple as that. Shocked, you told him that was obviously wrong, before pulling him in for a kiss." #NT!

 fbavariad.16.d: "It was time for one final date with the man himself. And you had an important question for him today. Things started off with some small talk and a long discussion about how everyone in Brazil who didn’t like him was stupid. He also kept talking endlessly about how much he loved ruling Brazil. He talked about how much power he had. He talked about how cool it was to be a leader. It was really annoying.\n\nSo you asked, “Do you love me more than Brazil.\" He claimed that of course he did, but that wasn’t very convincing.\n\n\"Are you sure? Prove it!\" He stood there for awhile. Looking at you. Thinking.\n\n\"Well, I guess there isn’t really a way to prove it. BESIDES GIVING BRAZIL TO YOU. It’s yours now. Please just love me.\"" #NT!

All the staff made sure you and the emperor received the most luxurious treatment possible. It did however feel a little weird having all the soldiers treat him like he was a god. For future dates you’d be making sure he stayed away from his military subordinates." #NT!

You blushed and gladly accepted this new land to start a Japanese collaboration government in. You talked for hours, but the entire time it seemed like there was something he wanted to tell you. Every word had another hidden behind it. His thoughts seemed to scramble around whatever he was truly trying to say. And then, as the sun began to rise, he finally said, “I want to make you the empress of Japan.\"\n\n\"What!?!?\"\n\n\"Yes, i want to make you the empress of Japan. I know it’s a little out there but I think it’ll be really cool.\" It took a few more hours for him to explain exactly what he meant, but in the end you thought it was really nice of him to want to give you a cool title like that." #NT!
