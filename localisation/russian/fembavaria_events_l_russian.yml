 fbavaria.1.d: "What at first seemed to be a Bavarian separatist group declared their independence earlier today, taking advantage of the German civil war. Everything seemed normal until their apparent leader, heir to the Bavarian throne, Felix von Wittelsbach gave a speech and reffered to the nation a couple times as \"[BVR.GetName].\" He also gave the speech in the form of a musical number and spoke in an oddly colloquial fashion.\n\nNo one is sure what exactly to think, but odds are, once the civil war is over, it shouldn't be difficult to rein them back into the fold." #NT!

Instead of silly press conferences the assembly of [BVR.GetName] has decided to address the public via cute concerns where all the members of government would wear pink outfits and dance. The general public and foreign leaders seem to primarily be confused, but it has been successful in garnering a lot of attention. \n\nMost importantly, in a daring move, all members of the assembly were wearing:" #NT!

 fbavaria.7.t: "A Show of Wholesome Patriotism" #NT!
 fbavaria.7.d: "Lederhosen, a traditional outfit of Bavaria, was worn by all assembly members on the main stage. Astopprecht’s choice of dress code was to display the national heritage and pride of the new [BVR.GetName], but most importantly to strengthen the feel of unity and revitalize the national pride of all proud bois in the new state!

Apart from the general cuteness factor of this magnificent piece of cloth, foreign leaders seemed very… appeased with what they saw. So appeased in fact that some foreign leaders even tried to communicate with assembly members while they were on stage.  No matter the embarrassing moments this caused, the public was happy to see the use of what will eventually be the glue that binds all bois together." #NT!
 fbavaria.8.a: "Very cute!" #NT!
  
 fbavaria.9.t: "The Closed Doors Concerto" #NT!
 fbavaria.9.d: "Following the first two concerns, Felix and his close allies Zelda and Squidward held a private meeting to discuss the true future of [BVR.GetName].\n\nMeasures would have to be put in place to delegitimize the assembly and ensure that Bavaria becomes a major player on the world stage.

All government institutes, schools and even factories have shut down for this wonderful celebration. Kiosks from all over [BVR.GetName] are selling cat ears and cat-paw thigh highs in shockingly low prices, in the spirit of national unity and cuteness! A wonderful speech was given by local authorities, stating that catboys have been part of German-speaking culture for years, referring to the famous catboy of Austria, Mozart." #NT!

 fbavaria.14.t: "Catboy Outfits Selling Like Wildfire" #NT!
 fbavaria.14.d: "Catboy appreciation day went fantastically, with coverage from all major media globally. While the spirit of introducing the world to catboyos was the main goal of the day, it appears the great prices on catboy costumes have led to a nationwide shortage. Thousands of buyers are still looking to get on the trend while some are scalping costumes in mass. This spike in demand has led economists to estimate an increase of as much as 600% on cat ears in the near future for an approximate 9 month period until production gets back on track." #NT!

 fbavaria.15.d: "Flower shops have been constantly empty for a week. Stores have been running out of wrapping paper. The empty shelves in chocolate stores make you think the Great Depression was still raging. Nothing unusual in the days leading up to the greatest yearly event in [BVR.GetName]: Valentine‘s Day.\n\nYou step out of the door, with a shining smile on your face. The midday sun is even more beautiful than usual. The birds are singing the loveliest song you have heard in a long time. Today is your special day. You‘re finally going out with your greatest crush.\n\nYou arrive at the park, just on time to prepare the picnic. You brought both your and thier favorite foods, and a very expensive bottle of wine. Just as you‘re finished, you can already see them walking towards the blanket you‘ve prepared. You give them the box of chocolates you prepared for them, and they try to hide thier blushing face. Seeing them so happy would make the coldest heart melt.\n\nAfter you‘ve finished eating and packing your things together, you go on your way to the theater. Even though it feels like you‘ve seen the movie a hundred times by now, you enjoyed every minute, because you could be with them. Together, you could‘ve watched 10 hours of a black screen and still have enjoyed it.\n\nThe day couldn‘t have been any better. And just like you, hundreds of thousands of other Bavarian citizens have had an amazing day with thier special one." #NT!

 fbavaria.16.t: "The Kiss" #NT!
 fbavaria.16.d: "\"A kiss?\" Wilhelm shouted. \"Why? What?\" He started pacing around the room as the diplomatic envoy sat in silence with a smug look on his face. \"Have your superiors approved of this?\"\n\n\"No... I thought it would be cute. That's all.\"\n\nWilhelm almost instinctively started banging his head into to the wall.\"Are you all this god damn horny? Like seriously. What's going on down there? Five seconds ago you're part of completely normal civil war germany, and now this?\"\n\n\"Welllll, uh no. I'm just the type of person who affirms the pwopular stereotype.

 fbavaria.29.d: "To the south of Bavaria lies a beautiful land of mountains and valleys: Tyrol. The region had always been a favored tourist destination of Germans, and especially Bavarians. Even though they are seperated by land borders, whatever happened in Bavaria always had an impact on Tyrol.\n\nIn the wake of the independence of [BVR.GetName] from Germany, the femboy ideals of its northern neighbor had influenced Tyrolian politics. This all cumulated in the founding of the FPT, the Fem Party of Tyrol. Fed up with the dictatorship located in Vienna, Tyrolians wish for a fresh wind in politics, just like what has happened in our country. What exactly thier goals are is still unclear however. Some suspect they might want a union with [BVR.GetName], others think they might just seek independece, or just a gradual shift in Austrian politics. Whatever thier goals end up being, we should look into this party as a potential political ally in the future." #NT!

 fbavaria.30.d: "The recently founded Fem Party of Tyrol has found itself in a very problematic position. As the biggest opposition to the current status quo, the Tyrolian Femboys have painted a massive target on thier back. It is only a matter of time until the Austrian government will engage in anti-cute measures. Some political experts even expect a ban of the party. Any interactions with the Tyrolian Femboys have to be quick.\n\nIt was a foggy morning at the border between Bavaria and Tyrol. Diplomats from out government have decided to meet up with the leading figures of the FPT to discuss thier dire political situation. \"We are fully aware of the dangers called out support for us poses to your government on the global stage.\", the leader of the party argued. But our Minister of Foreign Affairs assured the Tyrolians that Bavaria would be willing to protect thier ideological brothers to the south, even militarily if needed." #NT!

The FPT, outraged about this has issued a peaceful protest in Innsbruck, which has been violently supressed by the local police force. The leader of the FPT was forced to flee into exile in Munich.\n\nTensions to our south are close to escalating into outright war as more and more stories of street violence reach our newspapers. \n\nThis morning, the leader of the FPT has contacted the head of our government. \"We remember the military backing you have offered us.“, he said. „And now is the time for us to cash in on that favor.

The delegation brought the finest gifts [BVR.GetName] had to offer: Thigh highs, chocolate, cat ears and cute oversized sweaters with sleeves that were too long.\n\nIn the days leading up to the conference, the issue had been a hot topic among the governments ministers.\n\nThe French share the same enemy as us: Germany. Furthermore, a better relationship with one of the victorious powers of the Great War could help strengthening our legitimacy on the world stage. We need a strong ally to protect us from agression from the north.\" The standpoint held by the more pragmatic camp in our government, primarily the minister of foreign affairs, would definelty secure the position of [BVR.GetName] in this increasingly hostile world. \"Being under the influence of France is still preferable to being under the influence of Germany.\"\n\n\"We can‘t accept being under the influence of anyone! The more we cooperate with foreign powers, the more our cause loses legitimacy!\" The more dogmatic side of the government, led by the minister of internal affairs, was furious about this. \"There is nothing to worry about. Our superior cute tanks and thigh high-equipped soldiers can not only defend [BVR.GetName], but even conquer Germany! Working with the French will only bring us trouble!“\n\nThe only thing both sides of the argument could agree on was the fact that striped thigh highs in the colors of the French flag would look amazing.
