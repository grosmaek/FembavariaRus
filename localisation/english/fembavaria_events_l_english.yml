  fbavaria.1.t:0 "Bavaria Declares Independence"
  fbavaria.1.d:0 "What at first seemed to be a Bavarian separatist group declared their independence earlier today, taking advantage of the German civil war. Everything seemed normal until their apparent leader, heir to the Bavarian throne, Felix von Wittelsbach gave a speech and reffered to the nation a couple times as \"[BVR.GetName].\" He also gave the speech in the form of a musical number and spoke in an oddly colloquial fashion.\n\nNo one is sure what exactly to think, but odds are, once the civil war is over, it shouldn't be difficult to rein them back into the fold."
  fbavaria.1.a:0 "Play as Bavaria!"
  fbavaria.1.b:0 "This won't last long..."

  fbavaria.2.t:0 "The First Concert"
  fbavaria.2.d:0 "Astopprecht took center stage today as the Bavarian government began their first concert. Instead of silly press conferences the assembly of [BVR.GetName] has decided to address the public via cute concerns where all the members of government would wear pink outfits and dance. The general public and foreign leaders seem to primarily be confused, but it has been successful in garnering a lot of attention. \n\nMost importantly, in a daring move, all members of the assembly were wearing:"
  fbavaria.2.a:0 "Regular pants!"
  fbavaria.2.b:0 "Skirts!"
  fbavaria.2.c:0 "Lederhosen!"

  fbavaria.3.t:0 "Felix von Wittelsbach"
  fbavaria.3.d:0 "Felix, despite being heir to the throne, didn't seem like he wanted to reinstate the monarchy at all. As he did his musical number, he sung about the importantce of raising militias and properly defending Bavaria."
  fbavaria.3.a:0 "Strengthen the Militia!"
  fbavaria.3.b:0 "Let's focus on other things..."

  fbavaria.4.t:0 "The Second Concert"
  fbavaria.4.d:0 "The second concert was a lot like the first, but now people knew what to expect. Several new foreign journalist had arrived and some even helped with the performances. \n\nAs a parting gift, everyone at the concern was given a cute little hair bow. And the best part about them was they were all:"
  fbavaria.4.a:0 "Pink!"
  fbavaria.4.b:0 "Blue!"
  fbavaria.4.c:0 "Red!"

  fbavaria.5.t:0 "The Business Special"
  fbavaria.5.d:0 "But suddenly! Before everyone could leave, Felix announced a suprise performance by the stock holders and businessmen of Bavaria. They sung about how cool capitalism was and loads of cash into the crowd."
  fbavaria.5.a:0 "Ewww Capitalism"
  fbavaria.5.b:0 "Cute!"

  fbavaria.6.t:0 "The Third Concert"
  fbavaria.6.d:0 "The Third Concert was brief compared to the first and second concert. Nagisa, leader of the democratic faction in the assembly took center stage to try to explain to the crowd why elections were the best way to move forward.\n\nHis music number was nothing fantastic, but it seems to have got the point across."
  fbavaria.6.a:0 "Good, I guess?"

  fbavaria.7.t:0 "A Show of Wholesome Patriotism"
  fbavaria.7.d:0 "Lederhosen, a traditional outfit of Bavaria, was worn by all assembly members on the main stage. Astopprecht’s choice of dress code was to display the national heritage and pride of the new [BVR.GetName], but most importantly to strengthen the feel of unity and revitalize the national pride of all proud bois in the new state! This brave move put the foreign leaders in awe, and the general public praised this wholesome show of patriotism."
  fbavaria.7.a:0 "Cheers to the nation! Cheers to [BVR.GetName]!!!"

  fbavaria.8.t:0 "Skirts!!!"
  fbavaria.8.d:0 "To accompany the general cuteness, all members of the assembly were wearing cute pink skirts and thigh highs following [BVR.GetName]’s coat of arms pattern.  Apart from the general cuteness factor of this magnificent piece of cloth, foreign leaders seemed very… appeased with what they saw. So appeased in fact that some foreign leaders even tried to communicate with assembly members while they were on stage.  No matter the embarrassing moments this caused, the public was happy to see the use of what will eventually be the glue that binds all bois together."
  fbavaria.8.a:0 "Very cute!"

  fbavaria.9.t:0 "The Closed Doors Concerto"
  fbavaria.9.d:0 "Following the first two concerns, Felix and his close allies Zelda and Squidward held a private meeting to discuss the true future of [BVR.GetName].\n\nMeasures would have to be put in place to delegitimize the assembly and ensure that Bavaria becomes a major player on the world stage. No one inside or out of [BVR.GetName] could be allowed to stop them."
  fbavaria.9.a:0 "Bavaria shall rise!"

  fbavaria.10.t:0 "Closing the Pink Gate"
  fbavaria.10.d:0 "Following Felix's victory in the assembly, the overwhelming consensus has been to adobt an isolationist philosophy. The rest of Germany will be left alone, and we in turn expect to be left alone. We will create our own world here in [BVR.GetName]. And it'll be great!"
  fbavaria.10.a:0 "Hot!"

  fbavaria.11.t:0 "It Begins"
  fbavaria.11.d:0 "The sounds of cogs echo in the seemingly endless factory complex. Workers shedding blood sweat and tears in the vast chambers, all to keep the fuel machine running. The sheer tons of materials required for production are immense, the ecological disaster grand, but it will all be worth it soon, because one day….all citizens of [BVR.GetName]... Will look soooo cute! Crates of thigh highs shall be shipped off daily!\n\nFor now only factory workers will recieve shipments, but once they are able to use the natuarlly-infused cuteness to boost their working ability, more shall access this adorable power!"
  fbavaria.11.a:0 "A small price to pay for cute men"

  fbavaria.12.t:0 "Wilhelm Asks for Recognition"
  fbavaria.12.d:0 "\"So what you mean is that you are emperor-kunie?\" exclaimed the diplomatic Bavarian envoy visiting Wilhelm's residence in the Netherlands.\n\n\"Sir, are you sure we are not in some sort of a freakshow?\" whispered one of the guards to Wilhelm. \"Well mwister Wilhelmie, I think you are cuteeee…., we will make sure to recognize your countrwy to the scary suited men in the league of Nwations. But... you will have to do me a favour...\""
  fbavaria.12.a:0 "Come to Bavaria and make Astopprecht your regent!"
  fbavaria_12_a_tooltip:0 "This will §RCompletely Destroy§! relations with the Empire."
  fbavaria.12.b:0 "Make Felix your heir!"
  fbavaria_12_b_tooltip:0 "This will §GImprove§! relations with the Empire, but could lead to a §RSuccession Crisis§!"
  fbavaria.12.c:0 "Hand over a gazillion dollars!"

  fbavaria.13.t:0 "Catboy Appreciation Day"
  fbavaria.13.d:0 "Today the people of [BVR.GetName] flood the streets cheerfully to celebrate the yearly celebration of Catboy appreciation day. All government institutes, schools and even factories have shut down for this wonderful celebration. Kiosks from all over [BVR.GetName] are selling cat ears and cat-paw thigh highs in shockingly low prices, in the spirit of national unity and cuteness! A wonderful speech was given by local authorities, stating that catboys have been part of German-speaking culture for years, referring to the famous catboy of Austria, Mozart."
  fbavaria.13.a:0 "Very cute"

  fbavaria.14.t:0 "Catboy Outfits Selling Like Wildfire"
  fbavaria.14.d:0 "Catboy appreciation day went fantastically, with coverage from all major media globally. While the spirit of introducing the world to catboyos was the main goal of the day, it appears the great prices on catboy costumes have led to a nationwide shortage. Thousands of buyers are still looking to get on the trend while some are scalping costumes in mass. This spike in demand has led economists to estimate an increase of as much as 600% on cat ears in the near future for an approximate 9 month period until production gets back on track."
  fbavaria.14.a:0 "A sad day for us good boys"

  fbavaria.15.t:0 "Valentine‘s Day"
  fbavaria.15.d:0 "Flower shops have been constantly empty for a week. Stores have been running out of wrapping paper. The empty shelves in chocolate stores make you think the Great Depression was still raging. Nothing unusual in the days leading up to the greatest yearly event in [BVR.GetName]: Valentine‘s Day.\n\nYou step out of the door, with a shining smile on your face. The midday sun is even more beautiful than usual. The birds are singing the loveliest song you have heard in a long time. Today is your special day. You‘re finally going out with your greatest crush.\n\nYou arrive at the park, just on time to prepare the picnic. You brought both your and thier favorite foods, and a very expensive bottle of wine. Just as you‘re finished, you can already see them walking towards the blanket you‘ve prepared. You give them the box of chocolates you prepared for them, and they try to hide thier blushing face. Seeing them so happy would make the coldest heart melt.\n\nAfter you‘ve finished eating and packing your things together, you go on your way to the theater. Even though it feels like you‘ve seen the movie a hundred times by now, you enjoyed every minute, because you could be with them. Together, you could‘ve watched 10 hours of a black screen and still have enjoyed it.\n\nThe day couldn‘t have been any better. And just like you, hundreds of thousands of other Bavarian citizens have had an amazing day with thier special one."
  fbavaria.15.a:0 "You can‘t wait for next year."

  fbavaria.16.t:0 "The Kiss"
  fbavaria.16.d:0 "\"A kiss?\" Wilhelm shouted. \"Why? What?\" He started pacing around the room as the diplomatic envoy sat in silence with a smug look on his face. \"Have your superiors approved of this?\"\n\n\"No... I thought it would be cute. That's all.\"\n\nWilhelm almost instinctively started banging his head into to the wall.\"Are you all this god damn horny? Like seriously. What's going on down there? Five seconds ago you're part of completely normal civil war germany, and now this?\"\n\n\"Welllll, uh no. I'm just the type of person who affirms the pwopular stereotype. Hehehe.\" Wilhelm dismissed the envoy with no kiss taking place. Truly a sad day."
  fbavaria.16.a:0 "I cry"

  fbavaria.17.t:0 "The Industrial Aid Agreement"
  fbavaria.17.d:0 "Wilhelm has agreed that on his ascension to the throne of the New German Empire, he will industrially support Bavaria so long as they recognize him as the true emperor."
  fbavaria.17.a:0 "Cute!"

  fbavaria.18.t:0 "The Grand Ball"
  fbavaria.18.d:0 "Many today gathered in Munich for Crown Price Felix von Wittelsbach's grand ball. Unlike the concerts, this celebration required all attendies to dance. Felix made an extra effort to talk to the press and start flirting with foreign leaders. Things seem to be going well for this 21 year-old bachelor."
  fbavaria.18.a:0 "Nice"

  fbavaria.19.t:0 "A Little Practice"
  fbavaria.19.d:0 "Astopprecht, Lord Regent for Felix's father, offered to help out the young bachelor in his quest to secure the royal marriage of a lifetime. The regent made sure to teach Felix all his best tricks to ensure the 21 year-old prince undoubtably become an amazing king. In addition to this he also made sure Felix got the proper training in how to flirt with and get the attention of foreign leaders from Russia to America."
  fbavaria.19.a:0 "What?"

  fbavaria.20.t:0 "The Fate of King Rupprecht"
  fbavaria.20.d:0 "There's one lil secret that Felix has been keeping for some time now...\n\nFelix had been keeping his father \"prisoner\" by distracting him with an extremely comfortable lifestyle in the mountains.\n\nHowever, now that his father has learned of his sinister intentions, it's due time to decide what should happen to the monarchy."
  fbavaria.20.a:0 "It's time to make ammends."
  fbavaria.20.c:0 "He must abdicate!"
  fbavaria.20.b:0 "Abolish the monarchy."

  fbavaria.21.t:0 "A Missing King"
  fbavaria.21.d:0 "King Rupprecht Von Wittelsbach addressed a crowd at a preess conference the other day following his son's concert and since has dissapeared. No one is exactly sure what is going on, but his sudden dissapearance has done nothing but harm the stability of this newly independent nation."
  fbavaria.21.a:0 "Weird..."

  fbavaria.22.t:0 "Cuteness in the Classroom"
  fbavaria.22.d:0 "Today the Bavarian government announced a total revamp of the education system, revising many laws regarding education. Perhaps the biggest and most shocking change of them all is the introduction of kindness classes in the school curriculum. \"The scientific community sees this as a fantastic investment for the future generations, all the taxpayer money will definitely pay out, once we see the first results of our cute work,\" exclaims Dr. Cattech, a foreign scientist with a PHD in student psychology. \"The core principles of kindness, respect and more shall be taught on a regular basic in all grades of the new school system.\""
  fbavaria.22.a:0 "Knowledge is a weapon more lethal than any gun!"

  fbavaria.23.t:0 "The Gender Question"
  fbavaria.23.d:0 "The rise and acceptance of feminine men in [BVR.GetName] has had many strange consequences. One of these has been the unitentional rise of gender equality.\n\nFor the time being, [BVR.GetName] will be a state where everyone contributes. Especially when that contribution goes to the war effort."
  fbavaria.23.a:0 "Yay?"

  fbavaria.24.t:0 "Where is the cuteness?"
  fbavaria.24.d:0 "The streets of [BVR.GetName] seem grim... Everyone is walking along in gloomy clothing and all the stores seem to have rejected their previous pink and white patterns. It seems that the entire nation of [BVR.GetName] is at a crisis seeming so unimaginable yet so near... most Bavarian men seem to be rejecting their new feminine ways of life. If this continues to be, it could have immeasurable consequences to the state and crumble the founding principles of this glorious nation."
  fbavaria.24.a:0 "Minimum cuteness achieved!"

  fbavaria.25.t:0 "Can it get any cuter?!"
  fbavaria.25.d:0 "Today, in a rather ordinary day without any holiday whatsoever, everyone seemed wholesome… Rows of cute men and women flood the streets in hot pink skirts. Honestly, everyone seems so cuddle worthy nowadays that the urge to nuzzle within the populace seems hard to contain."
  fbavaria.25.a:0 "So cute, much lovely!"

  fbavaria.26.t:0 "The Cute Militias"
  fbavaria.26.d:0 "The Femboy Bible may preach Peace, but when it its Cuteness itself that is threatened, then it is every boi’s duty to defend all that is wholesome. His Cuteness the Fempope has called a Crusade to reclaim the Cutie Lands from the infidels, who would deny kittens their right to visit the wholesome places. It is time for the armies to put aside their differences and unite under one banner, the sign of thigh highs, and give back God’s children what is rightfully theirs, or die trying."

  fbavaria.28.d:0 "News have come out of Württemberg, the southernmost province of Germany, ever since the secession of [BVR.GetName]. Various cute groups from said state have loudly voiced thier support for our cause, criticising the central government in Berlin for not being feminine enough. Experts see a potential secession of Württemberg and a possible union with [BVR.GetName] as likely. The region has culturally always been closer to Munich than Berlin anyway."
  fbavaria.28.a:0 "Voice our support to the movement!"

  fbavaria.29.t:0 "The Fem Party of Tyrol"
  fbavaria.29.d:0 "To the south of Bavaria lies a beautiful land of mountains and valleys: Tyrol. The region had always been a favored tourist destination of Germans, and especially Bavarians. Even though they are seperated by land borders, whatever happened in Bavaria always had an impact on Tyrol.\n\nIn the wake of the independence of [BVR.GetName] from Germany, the femboy ideals of its northern neighbor had influenced Tyrolian politics. This all cumulated in the founding of the FPT, the Fem Party of Tyrol. Fed up with the dictatorship located in Vienna, Tyrolians wish for a fresh wind in politics, just like what has happened in our country. What exactly thier goals are is still unclear however. Some suspect they might want a union with [BVR.GetName], others think they might just seek independece, or just a gradual shift in Austrian politics. Whatever thier goals end up being, we should look into this party as a potential political ally in the future."
  fbavaria.29.a:0 "A positive development."

  fbavaria.30.t:0 "Tyrolian-Bavarian Alliance"
  fbavaria.30.d:0 "The recently founded Fem Party of Tyrol has found itself in a very problematic position. As the biggest opposition to the current status quo, the Tyrolian Femboys have painted a massive target on thier back. It is only a matter of time until the Austrian government will engage in anti-cute measures. Some political experts even expect a ban of the party. Any interactions with the Tyrolian Femboys have to be quick.\n\nIt was a foggy morning at the border between Bavaria and Tyrol. Diplomats from out government have decided to meet up with the leading figures of the FPT to discuss thier dire political situation. \"We are fully aware of the dangers called out support for us poses to your government on the global stage.\", the leader of the party argued. But our Minister of Foreign Affairs assured the Tyrolians that Bavaria would be willing to protect thier ideological brothers to the south, even militarily if needed."
  fbavaria.30.a:0 "Let's just hope it doesn't come to that."

  fbavaria.31.t:0 "The Boiling Point"
  fbavaria.31.d:0 "Relations between the Fem Party of Tyrol and the Austrian central government have been heating up more and more as the FTP has grown in popularity. The success of the FTP has inspired smaller cute movements all over Austria, altho most of them have been stamped out by Vienna.\n\nAustrian rhetoric has increasingly become anti-cute, and leaked government documents show an outlined plan of the Austrian military to forcefully dissolve the party, even at the cost of a Civil War. The FPT, outraged about this has issued a peaceful protest in Innsbruck, which has been violently supressed by the local police force. The leader of the FPT was forced to flee into exile in Munich.\n\nTensions to our south are close to escalating into outright war as more and more stories of street violence reach our newspapers. \n\nThis morning, the leader of the FPT has contacted the head of our government. \"We remember the military backing you have offered us.“, he said. „And now is the time for us to cash in on that favor. We require your backing to...\""

  fbavaria.32.t:0 "A Dye-er Situation"
  fbavaria.32.d:0 "Large flocks of concerned femboys have been seen running wild across all stores around the country, with multiple instances of violence in clothing aisles. Concerned government officials in co operation with factory owners have come to the conclusion that these incidents are linked to the same problem: A lack of pink dye. The demand for this now luxury resource has caused a massive spike in prices, making pink clothes not just really hard to find, but also horribly expensive. Civil unrest is at an all time high and the police force is expecting the worst, unless a new source is found."
  fbavaria.32.a:0 "Grumpy femboys are more dangerous than you might imagine..."

  fbavaria.33.t:0 "The Duties and Powers of the Regent"
  fbavaria.33.d:0 "While the assembly seems to have sided with Astopprecht, they didn't actually give the king or regent that much direct power. They have even began discussing elections for a Prime Minister of [BVR.GetName].\n\nAstopprecht decided to take matters into his own hands and write a proclamation greatly increase the king's and, by extention, his powers."

  fbavaria.35.d:0 "With everything finally prepared, [BVR.GetName] is ready to become the kingdom it was always meant to be.\n\nHowever, it's missing one very important thing: a king. The king went missing some time ago and most people seem to believe Astopprecht or Felix took him prisoner. Reguardless, now is the time to deal with this matter and decide what Astopprecht should be."

Officials are quick to clarify in records and statements that this has resulted in numerous confrontations with border security with surrounding southern and eastern countries, and processing facilities at peak capacity. The process of naturalization is slow, and supplies of warm humanitarian thigh-highs and cat-ears are low as our outdated immigration bureaucracy wains under the pressure. The official statement from our Fem-Citizenship Agency is that it is expected to pass, and merely an unexpected result of unique circumstances within Slovenia."

  #fbavaria.45.d:0 "Sometimes you have to sit and think for yourself, how can something so innocent go so terribly terribly wrong. Whatever the case may be, things have gone south with Astopprecht’s visit to Russia, as an organized force of NKVD officers have taken Astopprecht for interrogation.  Apparently his sightings have not just suspicious, but secret talks with corrupt NKVD staff to organize a coup that would instill the values of cuteness, similar to those at [BVR.GetName]. This event has spiraled into a domino effect, that led to a small uprising of femboy sympathizers and organized military and NKVD dissidents."

Furthermore, a better relationship with one of the victorious powers of the Great War could help strengthening our legitimacy on the world stage. We need a strong ally to protect us from agression from the north.\" The standpoint held by the more pragmatic camp in our government, primarily the minister of foreign affairs, would definelty secure the position of [BVR.GetName] in this increasingly hostile world. \"Being under the influence of France is still preferable to being under the influence of Germany.\"\n\n\"We can‘t accept being under the influence of anyone! The more we cooperate with foreign powers, the more our cause loses legitimacy!\" The more dogmatic side of the government, led by the minister of internal affairs, was furious about this. \"There is nothing to worry about. Our superior cute tanks and thigh high-equipped soldiers can not only defend [BVR.GetName], but even conquer Germany!
