  pinkrussia.1.d:0 "A man. A man has become quite powerful in the Eastern European territories dominated by Russian influence. This man, once named Ivan, now goes by a different name.

  pinkrussia.2.t:0 "Dreams of a Pink Russia"
  pinkrussia.2.d:0 "The Holy Pat-Triarch of the Order of Headpats, Ivan the Beautiful, wanted nothing more than to destroy the current Russian state and replace it with an empire of his own. Something new and controversial. And many in Munich and Sevastopol alike supported this endeavor. What fate await Russias is uncertain, but a terror of some form is nigh, and a clash between great powers is likely. \n\nAnd there is only one thing that will help us weather this storm:"

  pinkrussia.4.a:0 "A noble endeavor!"
  pinkrussia.4.b:0 "A waste of time!"

  pinkrussia.5.t:0 "The Patriarch and the Gospel of Art"
  pinkrussia.5.d:0 "Art! Art is the future and the past. If we replace art with war there is nothing to fight for."
  pinkrussia.5.a:0 "A noble endeavor!"
  pinkrussia.5.b:0 "A waste of time!"

  pinkrussia.6.t:0 "The Fem Language Theory"
  pinkrussia.6.d:0 "What Pink Russia needed was a completely made-up conspiracy theory to strenghten the cause. So the Holy Order of Headpats created the Fem Language. A Theory that all language originates from an ancient tounge only spoken by Femboys. It's rather silly but it seems to get people riled up for the cause."
  pinkrussia.6.a:0 "Nice?"

  pinkrussia.7.t:0 "Behold"
  pinkrussia.7.d:0 "Pink Russia is now ready to take on all of Russia and fulfill it's destiny. All that remains is the question of what future it wants to establish. One where the Patriarch rules supreme or one where the fellows fighting the good fight shape the nation together."

  pinkrussia.8.t:0 "A Pink and Dangerous Russia"

  pinkrussia.8.b:0 "Let's back away."

  pinkrussia.10.t:0 "A Pink Turkey?"
  pinkrussia.10.d:0 "It appears like Turkey has invaded pink Russia. Link, one of our generals, wishes to join the fight in Turkey and help the Turkish femboys establish a new state."
  pinkrussia.10.a:0 "Send him there!"
  pinkrussia.10.b:0 "Let's back away."

  pinkrussia.11.t:0 "A Victory for Pats"
  pinkrussia.11.d:0 "At long last, a Pink Russia has formed. We are whole. The Holy Pat-triarch and the gospels with divine help have unified this land. Now there is only one more step to take. A step towards forming the greatest and most ancient of empires. The cogs of time and insustry both turn as we race for this inevitable destiny. A shared hope of the revolution that started in Bavaria and now has destroyed Moscow. A shared hope that all secretly hold. But this time with an interesting twist!\n\nAnd I bet you could never guess what that twist is..."

Banish the monochrome monotony and embrace a palette of pastels. Soft pinks, baby blues, and gentle yellows shall reign supreme. Let your surroundings burst with hues that warm your heart and remind you of the sweetest candy.\n\nRemember, a smile is the key to unlocking the gate of cuteness. Wear your grin like a badge of honor and spread happiness wherever you go. Infect others with your joyous disposition, and watch as the world becomes a better place—one smile at a time.\n\nPlayfulness is not just for children; it's an essential ingredient for a fulfilling life. Dance, sing, skip, and frolic in fields of daisies. Let your inner child emerge from hibernation and revel in the wonders of imagination. Remember, life is but a grand playground, and you are the master of fun.\n\nEmbrace the transformative power of hugs. Wrap your arms around loved ones and strangers alike, sharing warmth and affection. A hug can heal wounds, mend broken hearts, and fill the world with a fuzzy, comforting embrace. Let hugs become the universal language of cuteness.\n\nIn a world overrun by seriousness and grimaces, The Pink Manifesto stands as a beacon of cuteness. Embrace the fluff, celebrate pastels, wear your smile, revel in playfulness, and share the magic of hugs. Together, let us unleash the irresistible power of cuteness upon the world, painting it pink with joy, love, and adorable wonder."

  pinkrussia.13.t:0 "The Bavarian Connection"
  pinkrussia.13.d:0 "Without support from Bavaria, Pink Russia would never exist as it currently stands. And to help us with our efforts to make Russia cute, they have promised additional aid. It is up to us what we ask from the sillies over there in [692.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nWhile new industrial equipment could be useful for making new and cuter clothes, an import of weapons and military advisors could be very useful for defending the pink line! Either way, this aid from Bavaria will be much appreciated."
  pinkrussia.13.a:0 "Industrial equipment please!"
  pinkrussia.13.b:0 "Send us your best!"

  pinkrussia.14.t:0 "The Beautiful"
  pinkrussia.14.d:0 "The Pat-Triarch was a man of eclectic tastes and a natural inclination towards the avant-garde. From a young age, he possessed an insatiable curiosity for the realm of fashion, always seeking new and interesting forms of self-expression through his wardrobe. While others adhered to the conventional, The Pat-Triarch danced along the edges of sartorial norms, unafraid to push boundaries and embrace the unexpected.\n\nHis closet was a treasure trove of unconventional garments, each with its own story to tell. One day, The Pat-Triarch would drape himself in a vibrant fusion of colors, combining patterns and textures that seemed incompatible to the untrained eye. The next, he would don a minimalist ensemble, effortlessly capturing the essence of simplicity in its purest form.\n\nThe Pat-Triarch's creative spirit drew him to the hidden corners of the fashion world. He explored boutiques tucked away in obscure alleyways and discovered designers whose names had yet to grace the pages of glossy magazines. In his hands, he held the power to transform an unknown artist's creation into a symbol of rebellion, defying the established norms of the industry."

He became a muse to emerging designers yearning to break free from the chains of tradition. With every carefully curated ensemble, The Pat-Triarch painted a vivid picture of self-expression, inspiring others to embrace their individuality.\n\nAs The Pat-Triarch's reputation grew, he found himself at the center of a bustling fashion scene. Invitations to exclusive events poured in, and designers eagerly sought his opinions on their latest collections. Even Lenin himself once positively rated a display of his.\n\nIn 1935 though things took a turn for the worse, forcing Pat-Triach, then Ivan the Beautiful, to exile in Bavaria where he plotted his eventual return. And that brings us to..."
  pinkrussia.15.a:0 "Vengeance"

  pinkrussia.16.t:0 "Vengeance"
  pinkrussia.16.d:0 "Now the Pat-Triarch sits on the border of something he did not originally know he wanted. Steps away from a new Russia united under his vision. Stalin and the other pretenders must fail, for the Holy Order of Headpats is the one true order than must until Eurasia. With his legacy in fashion fading, it is now time for this new goal to take center stage."
  pinkrussia.16.a:0 "United by a Lesson of Love"
  pinkrussia.16.b:0 "United by Powerful Determination"

  pinkrussia.17.t:0 "The Pink Parade"
  pinkrussia.17.d:0 "In the heart of a vibrant town nestled amidst rolling hills, there existed a spectacle that filled the streets with joy every year—the new Pink Parade. A celebration of cuteness in all its forms, this whimsical extravaganza had a special focus on the enchanting world of puppies.\n\nAs the sun painted the sky with hues of gold and pink, the streets buzzed with anticipation. Decorative banners adorned with fluffy clouds and smiling puppies swayed in the gentle breeze, announcing the arrival of the grand event. Balloons in shades of pastel filled the air, bobbing playfully as if echoing the excitement of the crowd.\n\nFamilies, couples, and friends gathered along the parade route, donning pink attire and sporting plush toys of their favorite canine companions. Laughter and chatter filled the air as people exchanged stories of their own beloved pups, their eyes alight with an infectious enthusiasm.\n\nAnd then, like a dream come to life, the Pink Parade began. The first float rolled into view, adorned with cascading pink ribbons and flowers, and atop it stood a bevy of adorable puppies. They wagged their tails and poked their tiny noses out from behind flower-adorned baskets, their eyes sparkling with pure innocence."
  pinkrussia.17.a:0 "Cute!"

  pinkrussia.18.t:0 "A Cute Tree"
  pinkrussia.18.d:0 "In Sevastopol, the first cute tree has officially sprouted. The best researchers Pink Russia has to offer have for some time now been developing a new breed of \"Cute Trees\" with pink leaves and pink bark. The exact science behind this is too far ahead of its time to understand, but it has now officially been successful. Following this, they discovered unfortunately that trees with pink bark already naturally exist, but they still are somewhat proud in their creation of new pink oak trees.\n\nRegardless, now these smart men are free to work on other projects!"
